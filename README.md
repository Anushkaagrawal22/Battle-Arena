3. Punch: Deals 10 damage to the opponent.
4. Kick: Deals 15 damage to the opponent, but has a 50% chance of missing.
5. Special: Each player has a unique special move that deals a high amount of damage (e.g. 50 damage) but can only be used once per game. The player must announce their special move before using it.
6. After each attack, the opponent's health is reduced by the amount of damage dealt.
